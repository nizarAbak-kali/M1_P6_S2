\section{Vocabulary}

Here are the 15 KEYS terms that are essential the concepts described in the summary :

\begin{itemize}
\item[•] gyroscopes  : component that you can find in new phones which gives the orientation on 3 axis .
\item[•] accelerometers : An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration .
\item[•] captors : device that mesures transistions of certain parameters for example a thermometer is temperature captor.
\item[•] integrated circuit : An integrated circuit is a set of electronic circuits . They are used in virtually all electronic equipment.
\item[•] Ubiquitous computing : Ubiquitous computing is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear everywhere and anywhere .
\item[•] Communications protocol:In telecommunications, a communication protocol is a system of digital rules for data exchange within or between computers.
\item[•] context aggregation softwares : it's a software that's going to assemble a lot of data coming from all the captors around him, and exploit this data .

\end{itemize}
\section{Summary}

The article is entitled "Decuplating our Sensorial feels" ("Décupler nos sens" in french).The authors are Greshon Dublon and Joseph Paradiso.
This article was published in decembre 2014 for the scientific magazine called "POUR la SCIENCE".The main subject dealed with in this article is the future possibility of enhancing human sensorial perception thanks to technology around us .
The first point brought forward by the authors it's that we are overwhelmed by technology all around us. We can find cameras and micros in ours phones.
We can also find gyroscopes and accelerometers in phones.
Then, they explained this phenomena by saying that captors have become more and more cheaper, smaller, powerfull and easy to use .So, the use of this technology is no more restricted for military use only, and by the time this technoly became used for civil use .
For the moment, all the data generated by those captors is not exploited or exploited only by one device at time. The true objective of this article is to talk about what will happen when all the data will be shared among all devices and how this new era will affect human  on the future .
The most know example today is the Google Glass that make poeple see an extra quantity of information before their eyes, and by the fact modifying human perception of the world around them .
