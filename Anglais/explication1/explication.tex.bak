\end{figure}

This diagram was introduced in the second part of the presentation. It was used to explain how quantum bits work. The image show two particules with two arrows pointing in a directions. Furthermore, we can also observe two level ( zero and one ) . \\
the two particules are quantic particules, which means they are very tiny particule that don't follow general physics laws . These particules follow their own rules, the quantic rules. The two arrows correspond to the direction of the magnetic field of the particle that turn . If the arrows is ''
